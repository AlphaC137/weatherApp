## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Django 4.0+
- Internet connection (for weather API access)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AlphaC137/weatherApp
   cd weatherApp
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   If you don't have an API key, you can get one for free at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

5. Apply migrations:
   ```
   cd mysite
